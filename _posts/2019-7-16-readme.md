## Summary

* Implemented an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) post-processing algorithm to enhance Tesseract OCR output by performing both error detection and error correction
* Accomplished Error detection by extracting error features from the output and building an SVM model to predict the location of errors; Corrected the errors by scoring each candidate word using Bayesian combination rule; Conducted performance measure on both word wise and character wise

## About OCR
Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example from a television broadcast).
