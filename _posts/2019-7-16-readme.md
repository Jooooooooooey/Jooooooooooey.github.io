# OCR Post-Processing Algorithm Implementation and Evaluation



## Summary

* Implemented an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) post-processing algorithm to enhance Tesseract OCR output by performing both error detection and error correction
* Accomplished Error detection by extracting error features from the output and building an SVM model to predict the location of errors; Corrected the errors by scoring each candidate word using Bayesian combination rule; Conducted performance measure on both word wise and character wise
